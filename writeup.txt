This solution builds a Flask-based upload and analysis service. It extracts text from PDFs using PyMuPDF and from images using Tesseract OCR. The UI offers drag-and-drop and shows loading states. For AI recommendations it provides a placeholder Gemini API integration; if an API key is not configured it falls back to a small set of heuristic suggestions. The focus was on delivering a clean, extensible prototype within a short time â€” easy to test locally, and ready to be extended with analytics or better model prompts.
